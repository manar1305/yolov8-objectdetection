# yolov8-objectdetection
Highway Vehicle Detection and Counting with YOLOv8
## Project Overview:
This project utilizes YOLOv8, a computer vision model, for real-time vehicle detection on a highway. The model accurately identifies vehicles, providing a robust solution for tracking and counting traffic moving in both directions.

## Usage:
The YOLOv8 Vehicle Detection Project is designed for real-time monitoring of highway traffic. It offers accurate vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, making it a valuable tool for traffic management and analysis.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [YOLOv8] : YOLOv8's Python interface allows for seamless integration into your Python projects, making it easy to load, run, and process the model's output, install it using:
- ```bash
   pip install ultralytics
- Then Import YOLO in your Python code:
- '''bash
   from ultralytics import YOLO
